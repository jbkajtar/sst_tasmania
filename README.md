# Tasmanian region sea surface temperature processing (tasmanian_sst)

Code for processing sea surface temperature data from observational and CMIP6 data for Kajtar and Holbrook, "Assessment and communication of risks to Tasmanian aquaculture and fisheries from marine heatwaves: Technical Report" (2021).

This code has been written to process sea surface temperature for the Tasmanian region (138°E-155°E, 49°S-35°S). Daily sea surface temperature data, from both observations and models, are processed. The observed sea surface temperature data is from NOAA 0.25° daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) over the period 1982-2020. The modelled sea surface temperature data is from 25 model simulations as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 6 (CMIP6) over the period 1982-2100, where two future scenarios have been analysed. Sea surface temperature data are provided on a native grid point basis across the domain. Area-averaged timeseries are also provided for five subdomains.

The data is publicly and freely available to download at <TBC>.
